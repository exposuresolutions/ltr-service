# Manual GitHub Repository Creation Steps

Since the browser has display issues, here are the exact steps to create the repository manually:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com
1. Open your regular browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Go to: https://github.com/new
3. Login as 'exposuresolutions'
4. Repository name: ltr-service
5. Description: Learning to Rank Tool Relevance Prediction Service
6. Make it Public
7. DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: After Creating Repository
GitHub will show you commands like this:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/exposuresolutions/ltr-service.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

But we already have the remote configured, so just run:
```
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Repository
Your repository will be live at:
https://github.com/exposuresolutions/ltr-service

## Alternative: Create via Command Line (if you have a GitHub token)
If you have a GitHub Personal Access Token, I can create it via API.
